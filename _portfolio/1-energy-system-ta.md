Sponsered through [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/)'s 
[Teaching and Learning Development Grant](https://www.sfu.ca/istld/faculty/programs/tldg.html), 
I worked with [Dr. Taco Niet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taco-niet/) to 
understand first-year engineering undergraduate students energy literacy skills. 

My role in this project included: 
* Researching teaching methods to improve student engagement and measure the 
impact of curriculum changes 
* Created online energy literacy problems to administer to first-year sustainable 
energy engineering students using the WeBWork platform 
* Analyzed the effect of the online problem sets in a students ability to 
understand fundamental energy concepts
* Wrote and submitted a full technical report the Institute for the Study of 
Teaching and Learning department at SFU
