OSeMOSYS Tools for Energy Work, or otoole, is a Python package which provides 
a command-line interface for users of OSeMOSYS. The aim of the package is to 
provide commonly used pre- and post-processing steps when working with OSeMOSYS 
models. Specifically, otoole allows the user to convert between data formats, 
process solutions, and visualise the reference energy system.

otoole existed before I begain contributing to the project in the Fall of 2022. 
This was my first experience learning how to work with community of people 
via GitHub to contribute to a shared project. Moreover, throughout this process
my software development knowledge and Python abilities significantly imporved. In
the spring of 2023 we released the otoole v1.0.0, the first full featured 
reslease.
