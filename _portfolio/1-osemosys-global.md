OSeMOSYS Global is my first publication as lead author! 

The Open Source energy MOdelling SYStem (OSeMOSYS) is an energy modelling 
framework for conducting long term energy planning studies. OSeMOSYS Global is 
an open-source, open-data, freely available global model generator that can be 
used to quickly and efficiently create interconnected or standalone, 
geographically diverse, electricity system models to address the trade-offs 
and synergies inherent in deploying renewable energy and expanded transmission 
capacity at scale across large geographic areas.

OSeMOSYS Global allows for flexible and fast scenario exploration studies. 
Its ability to perform model optimizations with different spatial and temporal 
resolutions positions it well to investigate a wide range of energy policy 
research questions. This is increasingly important when the need to take 
quick and efficient climate change action is needed.
