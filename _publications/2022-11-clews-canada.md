In this paper the Climate, Land, Energy, and Water system (CLEWs) interactions of biofuel
production are addressed. We utilize an open-source modelling framework to assess direct 
and indirect impacts of biofuels on long-term electricity generation, land, and water use. 
We analyse a switchgrass biofuels pathway and find that while the land use implications are 
substantial, increasing by 646,190 km 2 in agricultural land area, the impacts on water 
systems, which increases by approximately 222 billion m 3 compared to the baseline, may be 
even more limiting for the Canadian context. While switchgrass biofuels can contribute 
low-carbon dispatchable electricity, the land and water use impacts suggest that any 
biofuels should be used for hard to decarbonize sectors prior to using them for electricity.
