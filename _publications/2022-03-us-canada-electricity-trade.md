We investigate the role of U.S.-Canada electricity interconnections in supporting 
decarbonization efforts toward addressing both countriesâ€™ emission reduction goals. Using 
the OSeMOSYS energy system model, we calculate the generation mix and required transmission 
expansion between Canada and the U.S. under six climate policy and transmission cost 
scenarios. Overall, current emission prices will not provide enough incentive to meet 
stated emission reduction goals. Increases in emission penalties lead to increased 
transmission capacity. In all cases, the system requires significant dispatchable, 
low-carbon electricity to meet emission reduction goals and the flexibility of hydro 
resources provides significant system value. In addition to hydro and low-carbon 
dispatchable generation, the system requires significant investments in wind and solar 
in all scenarios.
