Energy system models are used for planning national energy systems. There is 
little practical guidance on how to best incorporate existing techniques that 
help plan energy systems under uncertainty. Given the large costs of energy 
infrastructure and the important role it plays in the economy, it is essential 
to improve the way in which we plan our energy systems.

One technique to manage uncertainty in models is called global sensitivity 
analysis. In this paper, we provide guidelines to conduct a global sensitivity 
analysis of an energy system model. We use simple energy system models to show 
how global sensitivity analysis works. We then use a more complex and realistic 
model to show what sort of results could be generated in reality.

The paper shows that using global sensitivity analysis provides added insights 
to those who develop and use energy system models. The approach can identify 
which uncertain parameters most influence the model results. This allows 
researchers to focus their effort on better understanding these parameters, 
increasing the robustness of their work, and increasing confidence in the models 
and their results.
