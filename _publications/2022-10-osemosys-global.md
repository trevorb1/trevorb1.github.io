# Abstract

This paper describes OSeMOSYS Global, an open-source, open-data model generator 
for creating global electricity system models for an active global modelling 
community. This version of the model generator is freely available and can be 
used to create interconnected electricity system models for both the entire 
globe and for any geographically diverse subset of the globe. Compared to 
other existing global models, OSeMOSYS Global allows for full user flexibility 
in determining the time slice structure and geographic scope of the model and 
datasets, and is built using the widely used fully open-source OSeMOSYS energy 
system model. This paper describes the data sources, structure and use of 
OSeMOSYS Global, and provides illustrative workflow results.
