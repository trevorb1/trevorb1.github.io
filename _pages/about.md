Hey, hello, hi! I'm Trevor, a PhD student in the 
[School of Sustainable Energy Engineering](https://www.sfu.ca/see.html) at 
[Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/)! 

My research focus is energy systems modelling. Energy systems modelling involves 
investigating how to decarbonize the energy system, including the tradeoffs 
associated with different decarbonization pathways. This can be researching 
methods to transition the electricity system off of fossil fuels, the 
implications and technical challenges with a widespread electrification of the
transport sector, or even how to reduce emissions in the agriculture sector. 
Moreover, my research encompasses both how to model these complex real world
systems, but also conducting case studies. By far the best part of my role as 
a energy systems researcher is that for every one new thing I learn, I  
discover that there are two more new things that I don't know about and have 
to go investigate!

Aside from school, I have a dog who continually throws my life into chaos; but 
I love him anyways! I also enjoy exploring Vancouver's excellent craft breweries 
and working on woodworking projects.
