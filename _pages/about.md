Hi! I'm Trevor, a PhD student in the [School of Sustainable Energy Engineering](https://www.sfu.ca/see.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/). My work focuses on energy systems modelling, which involves investigating how to decarbonize the energy system. This includes researching methods to transition the electricity system off of fossil fuels, the implications and technical challenges with a widespread electrification of the transport sector, or even how to reduce emissions in the agriculture sector. By far the best part of my role as a energy system researcher is that for every one new thing I learn, I also discover that there are two new things that I don't know and have to go investigate!
